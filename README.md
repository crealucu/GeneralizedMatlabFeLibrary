# Generalized Matlab Finite Element Library
The library provides finite element objects and functions to be used for solving 1D/2D/3D multiphysics problems. This library is suitable for beginners to experts. For beginners, the library can be used to study how to implement Finite Element Method using the FemLib class. For experts, the library can be used to test proof-of-concept problems before setting up the large problem because the library is very easy to set up multiphysics problems quickly.
